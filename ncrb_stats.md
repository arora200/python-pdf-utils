## Disclaimer 


### 1. 
### The information published in this report has been obtained from States/UTs 

### Police and CAPFs/CPOs.  National Crime Records Bureau has only compiled 

### and collated the data and presented it in the form of this report. As data is being 

### furnished by States/UTs/ CAPFs/CPOs, NCRB is not responsible for authenticity 

### of the information. However, any discrepancy observed in this report may be 

### brought to the notice of the Bureau. 



## Limitations 


### 1. 
### Since the publication caters to the ‘Principal Offence Rule’ for classification of 

### crime, the actual count of each crime head may be different from reported. This 

### is because among many offences registered in a single FIR case, only most 

### heinous crime (maximum punishment) is considered as counting unit.  


### 2. 
### The Socio-economic causative factors or reasons of crimes are not being 

### captured by the Bureau. Only police recorded crime cases are being captured for 

this publication. 


### 3. 
### Crime Rates (Crime per lakh population) of States/UTs have been arrived at 

### using the Mid-Year Projected Population of respective States/UTs of 2022 based 

### on 2011 census (Report of the Technical Group on Population Projections, July, 

### 2020, National Commission on Population, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare). 

### However, this is not available in respect of metropolitan cities. Crime Rates for 

### Metropolitan cities have been calculated using Actual Population Census 2011. 

Hence, Crime Rates of States and Metropolitan cities are not comparable.  


### 4. 
### ‘Crime Rate’ is not calculated for City-wise Crimes under ‘Children, SCs/STs & 

### Senior Citizens’ due to non-availability of Population figures of these groups in 

### the cities.  

### 5. 
### Clarifications on data for Crime in India are pending from Nagaland. Hence, data 

### from Nagaland State may be treated as provisional.

# Methodology for Data Collection & Publication 

## A) Data Collection and Compilation Process 

### Crime in India – 2022 deals with the crime data which refers to the calendar year (1st 
### January to 31st December of 2022). The data collection process including clarifications from 
### the States/UTs/Central Agencies started in Jan, 2023 and continued till June, 2023. 


### a) State/UT Police: 

### i. 
### The annual State/UT data for “Crime in India” is furnished by the 36 States/UTs in the 
### NCRB prescribed proformae through a software application developed by NCRB. 

### ii. 
### Similar data is also furnished for 53 Metropolitan Cities by respective SCRBs /CIDs (i.e. 
### Metropolitan Cities which have the population of 1 million (10 lakh) or more as per 
### Population Census, 2011). However, data pertaining to only 19 Metropolitan Cities with 
### population more than 2 million (20 lakhs) is being published in hard copy. The data for 
### remaining 34 Metropolitan Cities would, however, be available on NCRB Website.  

### iii. 
### Delhi UT comprises of both Delhi City and rural part of Delhi. 

### iv. 
### The data is entered by State/UT Police at Police Station/District level. 

### v. 
### A training is conducted every year for the functional officials (Police constables, HCs, 
### ASIs, SIs, etc. from all States/UTs) to explain the various issues concerning entry of data 
### in input tables. 

### vi. 
### The consolidation of District/State level data is done by State Police Agencies (SCRB/ 
### CID). 

### vii. 
### First level data validation is done at the Police Station/District level during the data 
### capturing process itself and Second level data validation is done at the state level at the 
### time of consolidation of District data through the NCRB application.  

### viii. 
### Data is scrutinized at NCRB for discrepancy / inconsistency. The same, if any, are 
### communicated to the respective State/UT for verification. 

### ix. 
### Amendments/Rectifications, if any, in the data are incorporated in the database by 
### NCRB. 


### b)  Central Law Enforcement Agencies/CAPFs: 

### Details of seizures and prosecutions under Prevention of Corruption Act, Direct Taxes 
### Enactments, Customs Act, NDPS Act, etc. as being furnished by CAPFs (Assam Riffles, 
### Border Security Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, 
### Indo Tibetan Border Police and Sashastra Seema Bal) and the respective Central Law 
### Enforcement Agencies (viz. CBI, Central Board of Direct Taxes, DRI, Narcotics Control 
### Bureau, NIA and Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs) have been published under  
### Chapter 20C & Chapter 20D respectively. 


## Page 15

### vii 

### c) Compilation at NCRB:

### i.
### After receiving final data from all States/UTs including Metropolitan Cities, All-India
### data is generated by NCRB.

### ii.
### The National Level tables for the “Crime in India” publication are generated through
### software application and cross checked for discrepancy, if any.

### iii.
### Calculations used in the table, if any, are mentioned at the bottom of the respective
### table.

## B) Methodology Adopted for the Present Publication (2022)

### a) Principal Offence Rule:

### As per the International Standard, the Bureau follows ‘Principal Offence Rule’ for 
### counting of crime.  In other words Principal Offence Rule refers to the system of 
### recording each criminal incident as one crime.  If many offences are registered in a 
### single FIR case, only the most heinous crime i.e. the one that attracts maximum 
### punishment will be considered as counting unit. 

### b) Population

## CRIME STATISTICS - A WORD OF CAUTION! 

### Crime is manifestation of myriad complex factors. The causes of criminal 

### behavior lie in the social processes and structures. People commit crimes due to the 

### process of socialization that does not develop strong sense of right or wrong and 

### ever-increasing desires act as strong stimulus for taking to crime to fulfill these 

### desires. The genesis of crime can be traced to interplay of various social, economic, 

### demographic, local and institutional factors. The presumption that crime occurs 

### because of the failures of police therefore exhibits a lack of mature understanding of 

### the theories of criminal behavior.  

### Further, these social factors along with other latent and concomitant factors 

### vary significantly across different regions, states and societies. The differences in 

### procedures over large geographical regions and method of functioning inherent 

### between organizations also creates wide variations. Hence, any comparison among 

### States/districts/regions/social groups etc. on the basis of these published data alone 

### will be too simplistic and is best avoided.  

### Further, no weightage has been assigned to the gravity or nature of the crime. 

### All crimes have thus been treated equal in counting the total crime for a State or City. 

### More crime registered say, in a city is, therefore, not an indicator of its being 

### comparatively unsafe than the city, where total crime may be less. 

### Lastly, as crime increases with population, Crime per lakh population (Crime 

### Rate) may be a better indicator to assess increase or decrease in crime. However, a 

### word of caution here! The primary presumption that the upward swing in police data 

### indicates an increase in crime and thus a reflection of the ineffectiveness of the police 

### is fallacious. ‘Rise in crime’ and ‘increase in registration of crime by police’ are 

### clearly two different things, a fact which requires better understanding. Thus an oft-

### repeated expectation from certain quarters that an effective police administration will 

### be able to keep the crime figures low, is misplaced. Increase in crime numbers in a 

### State police data may in fact be on account of certain citizen centric police initiatives, 

### like launching of e-FIR facility or women Helpdesks, etc. The increase or decrease in 

### crime numbers, however, does call for a professional investigation of underlying 

### factors pertaining to the local communities to suitably address the pertinent issues.

### Certain States like Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, etc. have provided the citizen friendly service 
### of Online  Registration  of  FIR under certain category of offences  like ‘Vehicle Theft’ 
### and ‘Other Thefts’.  As this may have increased  the   crime   reporting   under   such   
### heads   in   these   States,   they   become  statistically non-comparable with other 
### States not having such online registration facility.

### Certain States like Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, etc. have provided the citizen friendly service

### and ‘Other Thefts’.  As this may have increased  the   crime   reporting   under   such
